    "Based on this little experiment done above, bigrams seem to perform much better than trigrams when compared to the app features\n",
    "If we visually inspect the bigrams and trigrams by eye, they look like they have captured a lot about the essence of what the application does. However when compared to the manually extracted features which were just copied and pasted from the description of the app, and had no preprocessing done on them, the comparisons lead to not a very good hit/loss ratio for both bigrams and trigrams.\n",
    "But maybe that was because of the way I was comparing or the way I was calculating the losses.\n",
    "Overall, I think Bi-Grams and Tri-Grams are reliable for getting the gist of an app even though the hit/loss ratio i got was not very good. I say that because when going through the list of biandtrigrams I was able to understand what features the app has."
